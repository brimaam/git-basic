What is the difference between `add`, `commit`, and `push`?

The difference is that 'add' selects and add file changes, 
while 'commit' commits and records file changes locally, and
while 'push' shares and sends all the changes to the remote repository. 

'git add' adds the added or updated files to the queue to be committed.
'git commit' commits the files that have been added to the queue and creates a new revision with the changes locally.
'git push'  pushes all the changes in the commit to the remote repository.
